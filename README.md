*Zelia* is an experimental AI system that autonomously explores neural network architectures through an evolutionary process of creation, evaluation, and adaptation. By applying principles of genetic algorithms and selective pressure, Zelia continuously generates, tests, and refines networks to evolve increasingly capable models.

## Overview

Zelia is structured as an autonomous neural network ecosystem, where three primary components work in tandem to evolve architectures over time:

1. **The Chef**: Generates networks with randomized configurations and parameters.
2. **The Yelper**: Tests each networkâ€™s capabilities on basic logic tasks, retaining only the best performers.
3. **The Snacks**: Unique neural network models that adapt, compete, and refine toward optimized configurations.

## Project Structure

### 1. The Chef 

The Architect generates new neural networks with diverse configurations. These include the following components:

   - **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU.
   - **Optimization Techniques**: Variations in optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, enable a broad search for optimal convergence paths.
   - **Network Depth and Layer Architecture**: Networks are instantiated with differing numbers of layers and neuron counts to explore both shallow and deep models.

### 2. The Yelper

Does the tests and discards the weakest links.

### 3. The Snacks

The neural networks

## Evolutionary Cycle

Zelia operates on a continuous, autonomous evolutionary cycle:

1. **Initialization**: The Chef creates an initial generation of Neophytes, each with randomly assigned configurations.
2. **Evaluation**: The Yelper assigns a series of logic gate problems to each Neophyte and evaluates their performance on accuracy and efficiency metrics.
3. **Selection**: Tasty *Snacks* are retained, while weaker models are discarded. High-performance networks influence the architecture of the next generation.
4. **Iteration**: The cycle repeats, with each generation evolving based on selective pressure applied by the Yelper.
