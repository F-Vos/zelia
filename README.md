# Zelia - A Neural Network Chess Computer

Zelia is a chess computer powered by a neural network designed to play chess at a competitive level. I want to make use of the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) search algorithm.

## Features

- **UCI communication**: Uses a neural network to evaluate chess positions and suggest moves.
- **Bitboard output**: Adjusts the AI's strength based on user preferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **C Compiler**: GCC, Clang, or any other C compiler.
- **CMake**: For building the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/F-Vos/zelia.git
   cd zelia
